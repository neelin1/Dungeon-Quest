While we did reach 1250 lines of code, which is over the requirement,
I believe this to be an undercount of the total effort put into the project.
The lines of code represent only the engine for the game. The game is held
entirely in json / txt files that do not count. Probably over 25 hours of work
went into the data files, if not more. Just glance through the data folder to 
see the tremendous amount of effort put into the game that is not represented in
lines of code
