  Our project is a video game inspired by the 1987 roguelike, Nethack, and 
  tabletop RPGS like Dungeons & Dragons.
  Functionally, our game works as a game engine, taking in a text and json file
  and launching a game of Dungeon Quest. The player
  will battle through layers of a dungeon, battling enemies, avoiding 
  traps, and solving puzzles to reach treasure and escape.
