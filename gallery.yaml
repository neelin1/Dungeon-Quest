  Our project is a video game inspired by the 1987 roguelike, Nethack.
  Functionally, our game works as a game engine, taking in a text file
  (within said text file is a reference to a separate Json file holding
  additional data) and launching a game of Dungeon Quest. The player
  will battle through layers of a dungeon, battling enemies, avoiding 
  traps, and solving puzzles to reach the exit.
